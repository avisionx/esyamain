The event will span over 2 hours. <br><br>The details are as follows: <br>The participants will be given 3 problems of varying difficulty levels.<br>The first problem will be a warm up question. The participants will be provided a syntactically incorrect code written on paper. The participants will be required to identify the errors and type other two questions will be problem statements based on basic programming concepts.<br>Each team will be allowed one free “Screen time” (where the monitor screen can be turned on for 60 seconds), after which they will be penalised with 3 points for each extra screen time. <br>Each team can avail a maximum of 5 screen times. <br>At a time only 5 teams will be allowed to avail the facility of Screen Time, the slots for which will be allotted on a first come first serve basis."

Minimum time and least number of changes will be the criteria for judging along with the fully functional code. <br><br>Now get ready to start debugging and brag by finding the bugs hiding in the covers of the seemingly well-knit code.
