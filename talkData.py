Open source is a great medium to up your tech skills- code and develop huge projects, among other things, work with an amazing community of developers and building a wider network all across the tech world. The Meetup aims at bringing together a variety of open source communities, and instigate the coder in them by conducting talks on a wide range of subjects. The session will consist of a networking session along with technical talks, promoting open source culture through a panel session followed by QnA. Try not to miss out on the snacks and drinks :)",
