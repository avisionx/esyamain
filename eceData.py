Though, this is not what he intends to do now, neither does he possess any of the infinity stones. His priority is to reach Nidavellir, and build the mightiest blade in the universe, one that can match the power of all infinity stones.<br><br> But he’s not the only one heading to Nidavellir in hope of building the mightiest weapon; Thor- son of Odin is en route to forge “Stormbreaker”, a weapon even stronger than Mjölnir, his former weapon. Thanos has to reach before Thor gets Stormbreaker forged (5 mins).<br><br>6 Infinity Stones are hidden and distributed at 6 different locations in the universe; each possesses a ‘specific’ power, that may help him reach Nidavellir as quickly as possible. Thanos may choose to head straight to Nidavellir, or acquire some or all of the Infinity Stones on the way that may help him reach quickly, in the best case. There’s a lot of permutations finding the stones and reaching Nidavellir, and it’s your decision how to reach the destination quickest.<br><br> Not only you, other teams too are looking for Nidavellir, and your objective is to reach the destination quickest to obtain the mighty blade, kill Thor, establish dominance and fulfill your ultimate goal, wipe out half the universe. So buckle up, the competition is tough, but it is you who decide Thanos’s fate!"
